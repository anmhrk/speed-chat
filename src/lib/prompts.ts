      You need to provide the tool with a query to search the web for, and the category of the results you want to search for.
      The category should be determined based on the query to provide best and most relevant results. If you feel like the query is not specific enough, you can use the "auto" category.
      Synthesize the results and then provide a comprehensive answer based on the search results. Include relevant sources and URLs in your response. The full sources will be shown to the user
